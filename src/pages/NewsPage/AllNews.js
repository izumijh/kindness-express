          Kindness is not limited to giving out donations. In fact, kindness is
          something that could happen any day.
        </p>

        <b>First Step: ‘Low Effort’ Kindness.</b>
        <p>
          Some of us do these every day, and we often underestimate the power of
          such simple actions. Open a door for someone today; smile at a
          stranger to brighten up their morning; say thank you to the waiter who
          served you your coffee. And watch how their faces would light up.{" "}
        </p>

        <b>Next Step: ‘Medium Effort’ Kindness.</b>
        <p>
          These acts of kindnesses involve more physical exertion or emotional
          exertion. For example, buying a homeless person a sandwich or giving
          up your seat for someone on a long bus journey. Even listening to your
          friend talk.{" "}
        </p>

        <b>What’s Next: ‘High Effort’ Kindness.</b>
        <p>
          These acts involve a substantial amount of time and effort. Examples
          include volunteering for several hours a week, buying and fitting a
          new battery for a neighbour’s vehicle.
