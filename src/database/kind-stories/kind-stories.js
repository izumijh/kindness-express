            Dear stranger, I hope this story will prove that being kind is
            great!

          I was heading to my car today and an aunty walked up to me asking
          whether I have any parking coupons to sell her. ( She doesn’t know how
          to use a smartphone to pay for parking. )
        </p>
        <p>
          I found extras in my car, and I gave her one. She was happy and wanted
          to pay me back, but I refused. It feels great to be able to help
          someone out!

            Dear stranger, This made my day! So I was hoping it will make your
            day too:

          My neighbour knocked on our door and asked us if we had any extra
          trash bags today. I told him we didn’t, but offered him our trash cans
          to use, to which he declined.
        </p>
        <p>
          A while later, he visited us again, carrying a package of trash bags.
          He picked up a pack for us while he was outside! This kindness has
          brightened my day.

          I helped out someone at the post office! There happened to be a long
          queue there today, and I spent a lot of time queueing for my turn. But
          alas, I have to go for class and couldn’t wait any longer. I figured
          it would be a waste to just throw away my queue number, so I looked
          around me and saw an old lady with a queue number way behind mine! I
          gave it to her!

          Classes at school suck, but man this made me feel like a superhero.

          When I ordered food from GrabFood today, being the broke student I am,
          I ordered just enough sushi but not enough to fill the tummy. When the
          food came, an extra container filled with sushis were included. A note
          was included written: free sushi for you! :).
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps it's because it was their closing hours and they had leftover
          sushis, but it felt nice.

          I forgot the time I was supposed to board the bus home for Christmas,
          and arrived an hour late. It was terrible, and I even begged the coach
          to let me onto the next bus. Everything seemed hopeless until this
          very kind woman stepped up to offer me a seat on the bus!
        </p>
        <p>
          It was meant to be a seat for her daughter, who didn't come to the
          trip today. This woman saved my Christmas, and because of her, I get
          to see my family again.
