              Dear stranger, I hope this story will make you feel that being
              kind is great!
            </p>
            <p>
              I was heading to my car today and an aunty walked up to me asking
              whether I have any parking coupons to sell her. ( She doesnâ€™t know
              how to use a smartphone to pay for parking. )
            </p>
            <p>
              I found extras in my car, and I gave her one. She was happy and
              wanted to pay me back, but I refused. It feels great to be able to
              help someone out!
            </p>
          </Letter>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </>
  );
};

export default LetterInterface;
